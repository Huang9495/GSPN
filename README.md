## Overview
Code release for Geometry Supervised Pose Network for Accurate Retail Shelf Pose Estimation.
This is a GSPN which contains a GSL Module. Using VGG as backbone, I add GSL module into vgg as a monitor to supervise the shelf pose estimatiom, a complete pose of shelf containing three value in 3D space.
